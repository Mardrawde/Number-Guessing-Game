# Number-Guessing-Game
The game of guessing numbers is simple but fun. A number between 1 and 100 is chosen at random by the computer, and the player has to try and guess this number within a set number of tries.  After each guess, the game gives feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, which helps the player make a better guess next time.
